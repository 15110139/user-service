* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
* [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/) - gRPC is a modern open source high performance RPC framework that can run in any environment.
* [Monogodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) - MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era. No database makes you more productive..
* [Clean Architecture](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-introduction-to-clean-architecture-990c014448d2/) - Resilient software is divided into layers, underpinned by business logic and is independent of technologies.
